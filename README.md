🔧 Debugging Copilot — Tiered Python Help Assistant

Welcome to the Debugging Copilot — a Streamlit-powered assistant that helps you debug Python errors using tiered assistance and contextual hints from your course PDFs and notebooks.

🚀 Features

🔍 Error Understanding: Extracts core error types and keywords to improve retrieval.

📚 Context-Aware Help: Retrieves relevant slide pages from your PDFs stored in /data.

### Tiered Responses:

Tier 1 – Nudge: Gentle conceptual guidance and where to look.
Tier 2 – Guided Steps: Step-by-step breakdowns and references.
Tier 3 – Near Solution: Skeleton code or patch hints with citation.
Tier 4 – Full Fix: Concise fix with citations (only if explicitly asked).

🧾 Citations: Every answer cites slides or notebook cells to avoid hallucination.

🧰 Built with: Streamlit, LangChain, ChromaDB, OpenAI, PyPDF

🛠️ Setup Instructions

Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/debugging-copilot.git
cd debugging-copilot


Install dependencies
Create a virtual environment (optional), then:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Add your PDFs
Place course materials (slide decks, labs, etc.) into the /data folder.

Set up API key
Create a .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here


Ingest documents into vector DB

python ingest.py


Run the app

streamlit run streamlitapp.py

🤖 How It Works

User input: Paste your error and select a help tier.

Error parsing: The assistant extracts key error labels (e.g. KeyError, IndexError) using regex.

Context retrieval: Relevant pages are pulled from your course PDFs using Chroma vector search.

LLM reasoning: The assistant constructs a tiered response using GPT-4o (or fallback).

Response: You get structured help, step-by-step fixes, or citations with page numbers.

📌 Example Tiers
❓ User: What is SQL?
Tier	Output
1	“Check the slide titled 'SQL Review' on page 10 of the ‘Advanced SQL I.pdf’. What patterns do you notice?”
2	“Start by defining SQL. Then identify how it's used for data queries. Slides on page 10-12 of ‘SQL Review.pdf’ walk through this.”
3	“Here’s a short example of SQL: SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 21; Refer to ‘SQL Review II.pdf’, page 7.”
4	“SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage data in relational databases. It includes commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE... [more with examples and citations]”
🧠 Educational Use Case

This project was built for students at The Knowledge House to help them:

Debug with less frustration

Learn how to search contextually

Rely on course material, not just hallucinated answers

🐛 Troubleshooting

- 403 Errors → Check if your OpenAI API key has access to the correct model (gpt-4o or gpt-3.5-turbo).
No PDFs found → Make sure your files are in /data and re-run ingest.py.
"expected string, got dict" → Ensure error_parser.py returns a string, not a dictionary.

📌 Future Improvements

Add UI highlighting for retrieved PDFs

Support CSV/Notebook context (not just PDFs)

Automatic tier fallback if context is weak

History tracking per user session
